# The Backend

This backedn folder contains the nessiary components to host a backend for your applictions. 


## Development
To develop on the frontend you will need the following technolgies installed on your device:
- [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- After installing python you will need to install the required libraries in requirements.txt 
- I recommend using a python virtual enviroment (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
- To install the requirments ensure you are in the backend directory `cd backend`
- Run `pip install -r requirments.txt`
